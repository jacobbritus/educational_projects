# CLI to-do list

The second project for this repository.

I initially made it 3 months ago, but now I'll finish, improve and represent it here.

It differentiates from basic to-do lists by being customizable and the readchar module which reads keyboard input which allows for quick and flexible executions.

**Features**
- Listing tasks
- Changing keybinds
- Changing colors (to be done)
